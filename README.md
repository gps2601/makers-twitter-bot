### Makers Bot!


```
  As a manager,
  so that my staff can keep up to date with what is being said about the
  company on social media
  I would like tweets with #makersacademy to be posted to a slack channel
```

```
  As a manager,
  so that my staff can see just relevant details
  I would only like to see original tweets with the text, user and creation time.
```


#### Implementation hints:

* Speak to a coach about getting API keys for this.

```
  As a manager,
  so that my staff never miss a tweet
  I would like tweets to be posted on a regular schedule (every day or so)
```

#### Implementation details:

* This can be achieved by using Google cloud function or an AWS lambda. Be
very **careful** that api keys are kept secret!

```
  As a manager,
  so that my staff are not notified unduly
  I only want to see a post if there are new tweets available.
```
#### Implementation details:

* This one is slightly harder. If you don't get time to implement this
try and diagram what a solution could look like.
